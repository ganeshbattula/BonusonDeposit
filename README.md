# BonusonDeposit
Task 1:
I created a bonus calculator using React. 
The calculator takes in an employee's salary and calculates their bonus based on their performance rating. 
I created three input fields for the employee's name, salary, and performance rating, and displayed the calculated bonus amount in a separate section.
I also added some basic inline styling to the HTML and React components to make the UI look more presentable.

Task 2:
I added the bonus calculator to a React app that already had a main App component. 
I created a new component called BonusCalculator and imported it into the App component. 
I also created a separate JavaScript file for the BonusCalculator component, and added some basic inline CSS styling to the HTML and React components to make the UI look more presentable. 
Finally, we updated the index.html and index.js files to include the new BonusCalculator component.
